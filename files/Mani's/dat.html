              <h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
              <p> The goal of this 3-week project was to build a spectrum analyser that was capable of displaying the spectrum of the input signal from 0.5 to 5kHz when connected to a simple oscilloscope in time-mode. The project tested our understanding of many concepts that we had learnt from the analog circuits course that was taught the previous semester. The spectrum analyser consisted of a second order low pass filter, a doubly balanced mixer, linear ramp generator, local oscillator with frequency sweeping capabilities, a high-Q band pass filter and an envelope detector.</p>

              <h3>Wrist-Flexer <small>as part of National Service Scheme (NSS)</small></h3>
              <h5><strong>Guide:</strong></h5>
              <p>Prof. Manivannan, IIT Madras</p>
              <h5><strong>Overview</strong></h5>
              <p>Children with cerebral palsy have limited wrist-movement capability due to dominance of flexor muscles over extensor muscles in their forearm. The objective of this project is to make an exercise equipment which would help relax the flexor muscles from the early stages in order to avoid permanent setting of wrist position. </p>
              <p>
              To achieve this, we came up with a low cost design which can be made from things generally available at home. We used two bands - one worn around the palm and the other near the elbow - which are connected by means of an elastic band. The elastic band keeps the flexor muscles in the extended position by default and the user has to exert force opposing to the band to move his/her wrist. This provides a good way to exercise the forearm muscles. This device can be adjusted to different age groups but are primarily meant children below 10 yrs of age.</p>

              <h3>Smart Navigation</h3>
              <h5><em>Summer Project under Center for Innovation, IIT Madras</em></h5>
              <h5><strong>Overview</strong></h5>
              <p>The objective of the project is to develop a 'Smart Navigation' system for mobile robots which is independant of external directional-aids as opposed to Line Followers. A learning-based system is proposed here; where the mobile robot maps its locomotion (using Rotary Encoders) while being remotely controlled by a human from a hand-held device. During this process, the user can save required places as checkpoints (nodes). On sub-sequent use, the user can summon the robot to any saved checkpoint remotely from the controller. As the agent starts with a blank map, it remembers the path details using a unique, memory-efficient data structure which allows us to use our vairant of dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path to the target checkpoint. Furthermore, S-Nav has been primarily constructed for a differential drive system.</p>

              <h3>Understanding the Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves through General Coaxial Structures using Numerical Simulations</h3>
              <h5><strong>John F Welch Technology Center (JFWTC) GE, Bangalore</strong></h5>
              <h5><strong>Guide:</strong></h5> Vikram Melapudi (May 2013 - July 2013)
              <h5><strong><em>A patent application based on this work is under draft by GE GRC, Bangalore.</em></strong></h5>
              <h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
              <p>Effective propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves has a wide variety of applications. Here we study the practical requirements necessary for maximizing the bandwidth of frequencies in general Co-axial waveguide structures and also maintain mode purity. In this regard, well known antenna array design is verified using Numerical Simulations. Further these antenna designs were optimized for efficient coupling. Signal processing methods were also explored to enhance the SNR (signal-to-noise-ratio) and the utility of such EM waveguide systems. Finally, the effect of change in the dimensions of the coaxial waveguide on the transfer of energy through the waveguide is also analyzed using numerical simulations.</p>
